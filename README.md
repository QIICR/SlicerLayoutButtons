# SlicerLayoutButtons

This 3D Slicer extension facilitates the selection/display of labels or foreground/background images for a specific slice view.

The module panel consists of “colored” buttons that are arranged with the exact same layout as the current slice view layout used in 3D Slicer. 

Anytime the slice view layout changes, the module widget will adapt its layout and buttons so that those buttons “mirror” the exact same layout. Furthermore information are provided for each button about the currently selected label and background/foreground image for each corresponding slice view.
As you can see in the following screenshots, all buttons that are displayed in the module panel correspond to a specific slice view and color.
